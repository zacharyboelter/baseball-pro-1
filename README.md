# Getting Started

# Future Enhancement(s).
Update color palates to gradients that match the players teams colors <br>
as each player is searched for. Add team logo in corner.

Find multiple APIs with team headshots, team logos, career stats <br>
(individual for hitters and pitchers), and pull relevant information <br>
and create 1950s 'Tops' style baseball cards.
